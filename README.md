# Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

##  Objective
This task was part of a Cyber Security Internship designed to raise awareness about the potential threats posed by browser extensions. The goal was to identify and remove any suspicious, unused, or potentially harmful extensions installed in a web browser.

##  Tools Used
- **Browser**: Google Chrome (you may replace this with Firefox if applicable)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10
- **Manual Review and Research**

##  Steps Performed

1. **Opened Chrome Extension Manager**  
   Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` to view all currently installed extensions.

2. **Reviewed Each Extension Manually**  
   - Checked the **permissions** granted (e.g., "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit").
   - Reviewed **user ratings** and **reviews** on the Chrome Web Store.
   - Identified extensions that had poor reviews, outdated development activity, or suspicious functionality.

3. **Flagged Suspicious Extensions**  
   - One extension named "**Video Downloader Plus**" had overly broad permissions and questionable reviews.
   - Another extension called "**PDF Converter HQ**" redirected users to unwanted websites—this was a red flag.

4. **Removed Unnecessary Extensions**  
   Uninstalled the flagged extensions and others I no longer use to improve security and browser performance.

5. **Restarted Browser**  
   Ensured the changes were applied and checked for any improvement in performance or unexpected behavior.

##  What I Learned
- Browser extensions, while useful, can easily become vectors for malware, spyware, or adware.
- Some extensions request excessive permissions that can compromise privacy.
- Keeping only trusted, essential extensions minimizes the attack surface of your browser.
