## What I Did and How I Found Them

1. **Manual Inspection**: I navigated to the browser's extension page and reviewed each installed extension.
2. **Permission Review**: For every extension, I examined the list of permissions it requested. Extensions with access to all websites or the ability to change browser settings were investigated further.
3. **Online Verification**: I searched for each extension's name on the Chrome Web Store and cybersecurity discussion forums to check for any negative feedback or security alerts.
4. **Decision Making**: Based on the research and analysis, I decided which extensions were safe to keep and which were risky and needed removal.
